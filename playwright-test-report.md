## Issues and Observations

### No Critical Issues Found
All functionality tested works as expected.

### Minor Observations:
1. **Validation Messages:** The boat length validation appears to use HTML5 validation rather than custom error messages. While functional, custom error messages might provide better user feedback.

2. **Service Interval Selection:** The interval selection uses clickable divs rather than radio buttons, which works well but should be tested for keyboard accessibility.

3. **Checkout Form:** The boat length field in checkout is pre-filled and read-only, which is good for data consistency.

## Screenshots Generated
All 19 screenshots were successfully generated and saved in the `screenshots/` directory:
- Initial views and form states

## Recommendations
1. Consider adding visible error messages for form validation
2. Test keyboard navigation through the multi-step form
3. Consider adding loading states if API calls are made
4. Test with screen readers for accessibility
