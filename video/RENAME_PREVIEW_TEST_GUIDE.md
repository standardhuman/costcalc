This guide provides comprehensive test scenarios for the rename preview functionality in BOATY.

## Prerequisites

1. BOATY application running at http://localhost:5000 (or http://localhost:8080 if using launcher.py)
2. At least 3-5 video files in the source directory
3. Web browser (Chrome, Firefox, or Safari)

## Test Scenarios

   ```
5. Keep the default date (today)
6. Click "Preview Rename" button

**Expected Results:**
- Preview table appears below the form
- Each video is assigned to a boat
- Preview filenames show format: `[Boat Name] MM-DD-YYYY [Position] (Type).ext`
- Original form is hidden

**Screenshot Points:**
- Before clicking preview

### 2. Edit Preview Assignments üìù

**Prerequisites:** Complete Test 1 (stay in preview mode)

**Steps:**
1. In the first row, change boat name to "Modified Boat"

4. Click "Preview Rename" again
5. Make some changes
6. Click "Apply Rename"

## Automated Testing

Two test scripts are available:

1. **test_rename_preview.py** - API and backend testing
   ```bash
   python3 test_rename_preview.py
   ```

2. **test_rename_preview_playwright.py** - Full UI automation testing
   ```bash
   # Install playwright first:
   pip install playwright
   playwright install chromium
   
   # Run tests:
   python3 test_rename_preview_playwright.py
   ```

## Tips for Testing

1. **Reset between tests**: Refresh the page between major test scenarios
2. **Check console**: Open browser developer tools (F12) and check for JavaScript errors
3. **Network tab**: Monitor API calls in the Network tab
4. **Mobile view**: Test responsive behavior using browser's device emulation
5. **Take screenshots**: Document any issues with screenshots

## Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Preview not updating**: Check browser console for JavaScript errors
2. **Drag-drop not working**: Try different browsers, some have better support
3. **Special characters causing errors**: Document which characters cause issues
4. **Slow performance**: Note the number of videos when slowness occurs
