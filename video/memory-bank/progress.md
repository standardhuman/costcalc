# Progress: BOATY

## What Works
- Memory Bank structure initialized and actively used.
- Configuration of video file paths (`config.json`) updated to correct subdirectories.
- Basic video renaming functionality (backend logic in `utils/file_operations.py` and frontend trigger in `static/js/main.js`) confirmed working.
- UI for step-based workflow (Source, Rename, Upload) is navigable.
- Breadcrumb workflow, folder access buttons, and basic UI elements render correctly.
- **Dependency Management:** Pinned `Werkzeug==2.0.3` in `requirements.txt` to resolve Flask compatibility issues.
- **Launcher:** `launcher.py` updated for correct virtual environment.
- **JavaScript Error Fixes:** Resolved `ReferenceError` issues related to `uploadVideos`, `undoRename`, and `showStep` calls in `static/js/main.js`.
- **YouTube Uploads:**
    - Videos are successfully uploading to YouTube, including playlist handling.
    - The `KeyError: 'paused'` issue in `app.py` related to `upload_status` initialization has been resolved.
    - Throttling logic in `utils/youtube_api.py` has been refined for accuracy.
    - Progress reporting (both chunk-level and overall status callback) is functional.
    - Logging has been adjusted for cleaner default output (INFO level for key events, DEBUG for verbose details like chunk progress and throttling).
- Project structure refactoring completed previously.

## What's Left to Build / Verify
- **Revert Temporary Workaround:** Remove the modification made to `utils/file_operations.py::rename_videos` that allows skipping the "no source videos" check.
- **Comprehensive User Testing:** Conduct full end-to-end tests of the renaming and upload workflow to ensure stability and usability.
- **UI/UX & Upload Enhancements (Planned, from `tasks.md`):**
    - Further improve real-time upload progress display in the UI based on the now-stable backend reporting.
    - Make video thumbnails smaller and more compact.
    - Group videos by boat in the UI.
    - Visually improved upload preview, possibly integrated with video/boat sections.
    - (Future) Pause/resume upload support (backend logic for pause/resume is present via `upload_status['paused']` and `pause_check` in YouTubeAPI; UI integration needed).
- Implement and document other core BOATY features as per `projectbrief.md`.
- Expand Memory Bank with more detailed feature-specific and integration documentation.
- Develop comprehensive unit and integration tests.
- Establish CI/CD pipelines.

## Current Status
- Application runs, and YouTube uploads are now stable and completing successfully.
- Logging provides good visibility into the upload process, with configurable verbosity.
- Ready to remove the temporary workaround in file operations and proceed with broader user testing.

## Known Issues
- **Temporary Workaround:** `utils/file_operations.py` has a temporary change to allow progress to Step 3; must be reverted.
- Browser Automation Instability: Browser MCP tool experienced repeated disconnects previously, hindering UI-driven debugging (though less critical now that core uploads work).

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- Committed to maintaining the Memory Bank.
- Prioritizing modularity, extensibility, and maintainability.
- UI Redesign (breadcrumb/checkout style) and real-time progress implemented earlier.
- Decision to unify 'source' and 'upload' directories reversed; config updated to point to specific subdirectories.
- Refinement of JavaScript error handling and function scoping based on recent debugging.
- Pinned Werkzeug version to fix runtime errors.
- **Added temporary workaround** in file operations to bypass UI blockage due to state mismatches between sessions (next to be removed).
- **Iteratively debugged YouTube upload process:** Addressed `KeyError` by ensuring consistent `upload_status` initialization, refined throttling, added detailed logging, and then adjusted logging levels for better production use.
