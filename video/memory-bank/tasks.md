# Tasks: BOATY

## Active Tasks
- **User Test:** Verify fixes for the video rename-to-upload workflow. Ensure UI progresses to Step 3, dry run report appears, "Upload to YouTube" button functions, and YouTube authentication is triggered correctly.
- Review BOATY_PRD.md to update documentation with specific project details (ongoing).
- Analyze app.py and core application structure (ongoing).
- Identify implementation priorities based on PRD requirements (ongoing).

## Completed Tasks
- Debug and fix critical JavaScript errors in `static/js/main.js` that halted the UI after video renaming (related to `collapseSection`/`toggleSection` scoping and `.catch` block in `renameVideos`).
- Update `config.json` to use a unified directory for 'source' and 'upload' stages.
- Implement folder access API in app.py.
- Update main.js and index.html for breadcrumb workflow and folder access buttons.
- Refactor upload progress logic for more granular, real-time updates and stats.
- Refactored upload progress polling to 1s interval.
- Initialize Memory Bank structure.
- Create core documentation files.

## Backlog
- Document YouTube API integration approach in detail.
- Perform detailed technical audit of existing code.
- Create test plan and test framework.
- Implement upload throttling feature.
- Enhance video organization workflow further based on user feedback.

## Blockers
- None identified. Awaiting user testing results for recent fixes.
