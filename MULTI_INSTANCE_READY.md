## Launch Instructions

### Step 1: Open Terminal Windows

Open 6 separate terminal windows/tabs:

```bash
# Terminal 1: Estimator
cd /Users/brian/app-development/sailorskills-repos/sailorskills-estimator
claude

# Terminal 2: Schedule
cd /Users/brian/app-development/sailorskills-repos/sailorskills-schedule
claude

# Terminal 3: Billing
cd /Users/brian/app-development/sailorskills-repos/sailorskills-billing
claude

# Terminal 4: Inventory
cd /Users/brian/app-development/sailorskills-repos/sailorskills-inventory
claude

# Terminal 5: Video
cd /Users/brian/app-development/sailorskills-repos/sailorskills-video
claude

# Terminal 6: Admin
cd /Users/brian/app-development/sailorskills-repos/sailorskills-admin
claude
```

### Step 2: Give Context (Optional)

Each instance will automatically read its CLAUDE.md file. You can optionally give additional context:

**Example for Estimator:**
> "Focus on the pricing calculator. The CLAUDE.md has all the details."

**Example for Inventory:**
> "Work on the low stock alert system. Check CLAUDE.md for architecture."

### Step 3: Start Development

Give each instance tasks and they'll work independently:
- No merge conflicts
- Parallel development
- Independent testing
- Separate deployments

---

## Example: Parallel Development Session

**Goal:** Add 3 features across different products

**You ‚Üí Instance #1 (Estimator):**
> "Add a 'Quick Quote' button that gives rough estimates without full form"

**You ‚Üí Instance #2 (Schedule):**
> "Add SMS notifications when bookings are confirmed"

**You ‚Üí Instance #4 (Inventory):**
> "Add CSV export for inventory reports"

**All work simultaneously:**
- Each reads their CLAUDE.md for context
- Each tests with Playwright MCP
- Each pushes to GitHub when done
- Each deploys to Vercel independently

**Result:** 3 features complete in parallel, no conflicts!

---

## Benefits of This Setup

### 1. Context Isolation ‚úÖ
Each instance only knows about its product:
- Estimator instance doesn't see inventory code
- Schedule instance doesn't see billing logic
- Focused, efficient development

### 2. No Merge Conflicts ‚úÖ
- Separate repos = no conflicts
- Independent git history
- Clean commit logs per product

### 3. True Parallelization ‚úÖ
- Work on 6 products simultaneously
- Features complete in parallel
- Development speed multiplied

### 4. Clear Guidelines ‚úÖ
- CLAUDE.md provides complete context
- Testing requirements clear
- Git workflow defined
- Integration points documented

### 5. Independent Deployment ‚úÖ
- Each push triggers Vercel deploy
- No dependency on other products
- Fast deployment pipeline

---

## CLAUDE.md Highlights

### Testing Directive (All Repos)
```markdown
**IMPORTANT**: Always follow these steps after making code changes:

1. **Test Locally**: Run dev server and manually test
2. **Test with Playwright**: Run Playwright MCP tests to verify functionality
3. **Check Database**: Verify database operations work correctly
4. **Commit**: Commit changes with clear message
5. **Push to GitHub**: Push to `main` branch (triggers deployment)
```

### Integration Points Example (Schedule)
```markdown
### ‚Üê Estimator Product
- Receives bookings created by customer quotes
- Reads `bookings` table for new appointments
- Shares customer_id and service_type

### ‚Üí Billing Product
- Marks service as completed
- Triggers invoice generation
- Updates booking status to "completed"
```

### Common Tasks Example (Billing)
```markdown
### Processing Payment
1. Find invoice
2. Click "Process Payment"
3. Select payment method
4. Confirm charge amount
5. Process payment
6. Mark invoice as paid
7. Send receipt
```

---

## Shared Package Integration

All repos have the shared package as a git submodule:

```bash
# Each repo can use shared utilities
import {
  createSupabaseClient,
  SimpleAuth,
  initStripe,
  showToast,
  createModal
} from './shared/src/index.js';
```

**Update shared package:**
```bash
cd shared
git pull origin main
cd ..
git add shared
git commit -m "Update shared package"
git push
```

---

## Coordination Strategy

Since Claude instances can't communicate directly:

### 1. Database Communication
Products share data via Supabase:
- Estimator creates bookings ‚Üí Schedule reads
- Schedule completes service ‚Üí Billing invoices
- All products ‚Üí Admin aggregates

### 2. You as Orchestrator
Tell each instance their part:
- "Estimator: Write bookings with this schema"
- "Schedule: Read bookings with this schema"
- "Admin: Display bookings from both"

### 3. Shared Package
Common code stays in sync via git submodule:
- Auth logic shared
- UI components shared
- API clients shared

---
